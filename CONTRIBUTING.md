## 📌 Contributor Guidelines

### 🧑‍💻 Issue Assignment

- 🟢 You can **only start working on an issue once it has been officially assigned to you**.
- 🏃‍♀️ We follow a **first come, first serve** policy — the **first person to comment** on an issue will be assigned.
- 🚫 **PRs for unassigned issues will not be accepted or merged.**
- 🧠 If you're already assigned to an issue, you **must get your current PR at least approved** (even if not merged) **before claiming a new issue**.

---

### ⏳ Inactive Issues

- 💤 If there is **no activity for 3 days** after assignment, the issue will be marked as **`stale`**.
- 🔁 After being marked stale for **12 more hours**, the issue will be **unassigned and reassigned** to another contributor to ensure progress.

---

### 🕒 Requesting Extensions

- 🗓️ If you require more time, please **inform a maintainer before the issue is marked stale**.
- 🧍 We understand delays happen — just communicate and request an extension politely!

---

### 🔄 Pull Request (PR) Management

#### ⚠️ Keeping PRs Up-to-Date

- 🆕 Always ensure your PR is **up-to-date with the latest changes** from the `main` branch.
- 💻 Run `git pull` regularly on your fork/branches to avoid merge conflicts or outdated changes.
- 🧪 This helps maintainers test and review your changes smoothly without delays.

#### 💤 Inactive Pull Requests

- ⏸️ PRs with no activity for **3 days** will be **marked as stale**.
